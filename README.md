52 weeks in a year 14 days is is 2 weeks

26 lunar days go by in one Earth year

it's not feasible to make a time zone for the moon

it's more feasible that every 14 days on a regular calendar should indicate a day on the moon Jan 14 is day 1 on the moon

Jan 28th is the second day on the moon 

should be part of the official calendar that we use 

the date on earth should correlate with the day on the moon
